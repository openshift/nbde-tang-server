## Introduction

The NBDE Tang server operator provides [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053)
technology for OpenShift/K8S. It deploys one or several Tang servers automatically.
The Tang server container image to launch is configurable, and will use the latest one
available by default. This operator has been developed using [operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/)
framework.

The operator avoids having to follow all Tang manual installation steps,
and leverages some of the features provided by OpenShift: multi-replica deployment,
scale-in/out, scale up/down or traffic load balancing.

This operator also allows automation of certain operations, which are error-prone
if executed manually. Examples of these operations are:
- server deployment
- configuration
- key rotation
- hidden keys deletion

Up to date, it is deployed through a [CRD](https://github.com/openshift/nbde-tang-server/blob/main/bundle/manifests/nbde-tang-server.clusterserviceversion.yaml#L52)
(Custom Resource Definition), containing its proper configuration values to perform
appropriate Tang server operations.

## Installation

In order to install this operator, you must have previously installed
an OpenShift/K8S cluster. For small computers, **CRC** (Code Ready Containers)
project is recommended. In case normal OpenShift cluster is used,
installation should not differ from the CRC one. Ultimately, the operator has
been included in Red Hat OpenShift catalog, named as
[NBDE Tang Server](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/651c310f3b4c44380c45b7c9).

Instructions for **CRC** installation can be observed
in the [Links](#links) section.
Apart from cluster, the corresponding client is required to check
the status of the different Pods, Deployments and Services. Required
OpenShift client to install is `oc`, whose installation can be
checked in the [Links](#links) section.

Once OpenShift/K8S cluster is installed, operator can be installed
through operator-sdk.
operator-sdk installation is described in the [Links](#links) section.

In order to deploy the latest version of the operator, check latest released
version in the [Versions](#versions) section, and install the appropriate version
bundle. For example, in case latest version is **1.1.1**, the command to execute
will be:

```bash
$ operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:latest
```

To install latest multi-arch image, execute:
```bash
$ operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/sec-eng-special/tang-operator-bundle:multi-arch
```

If the message **OLM has successfully installed** is displayed, it is a sign of a
proper installation of the operator.

If a message similar to **"failed open: failed to do request: context deadline exceeded"**,
is shown, it is possible that a timeout is taking place. Try to increase the timeout values
in case your cluster takes long time to deploy. To do so, the option **--timeout** can be
used (if not used, default time is 2m, which stands for two minutes):

```bash
$ operator-sdk run bundle --timeout 3m quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:v1.1.1
INFO[0008] Successfully created registry pod: quay-io-sec-eng-special-nbde-tang-server-bundle-v1.1.1
...
INFO[0031] OLM has successfully installed "nbde-tang-server.v1.1.1"
```

Additionally, correct installation can be observed if an output like
the following is observed when prompting for installed pods:

```bash
$ oc get pods
NAME                                                  READY STATUS    RESTARTS AGE
dbbd1837106ec169542546e7ad251b95d27c3542eb0409c1e     0/1   Completed 0        82s
quay-io-tang-nbde-tang-server-bundle-v1.1.1           1/1   Running   0        90s
nbde-tang-server-controller-manager-5c9488d8dd-mgmsf  2/2   Running   0        52s
```

Note the **Completed** and **Running** state for the different operator pods.

Once operator is correctly installed, appropriate configuration can be applied
from `config` directory. Minimal installation, that just provides the number
of replicas (1) to use, is the recommended operator configuration to apply:

```bash
$ oc apply -f operator_configs/minimal
namespace/nbde created
tangserver.nbde.openshift.io/tangserver created
```

In case operator is appropriately configured, **nbde** namespace should contain
the service, deployment and its related pods:

```
$ oc -n nbde get services
NAME               TYPE         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
service-tangserver LoadBalancer 172.30.167.129 34.133.181.172 8080:30831/TCP 58s

$ oc -n nbde get deployments
NAME              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
tsdp-tangserver   1/1     1            1           63s

$ oc -n nbde get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tsdp-tangserver-55f747757c-599j5   1/1     Running   0          40s
```

Note the **Running** state for the `tangserver` pods.

## Compilation

Requirements for operator compilation are as follows:
* Go compiler (v1.19.6+). Recommended version: v1.23.2.
* Docker (v24.0.7+ recommended). Podman (v4.9.0+ recommended) can be used as an alternative to Docker.

Compilation of operator needs to be performed in top directory, by executing
**make docker-build**. The name of the image must be provided. In case there
is no requirement to update the version, same version compared to the last
version can be used. Otherwise, if new version of the operator is going
to be released, it is recommended to increase version appropriately.

In this case, same version is used. Last released version can be observed in
[Versions](#versions) section.

To summarize, taking into account that the last released version is **v1.1.1**,
compilation can be done with next command:

```bash
$ make docker-build docker-push IMG="quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server:v1.1.1"
...
Successfully built 4a88ba8e6426
Successfully tagged sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server:v1.1.1

```

It is possible to use `podman` instead of `docker`:

```bash
$ make podman-build podman-push IMG="quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server:v1.1.1"
...
Successfully built 4a88ba8e6426

```

In case a new release is planned to be done, the steps to follow will be:

- <ins>Modify Makefile so that it contains the new version</ins>:

```bash
$ git diff Makefile
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index 9a41c6a..db12a82 100644

Apart from previous changes, it is recommended to generate a "latest" tag for nbde-tang-server bundle:

```bash
$ docker tag quay.io/sec-eng-special/perator-bundle:v1.1.1 quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:latest
$ docker push quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:latest

In case `podman` is being used:

```bash
$ podman tag quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:v1.1.1 quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:latest
$ podman push quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:latest

```
Examples of architectures to cross-compile are:
* `ppc64le`
* `s390x`
* `arm64`
* `mips64`
* `riscv64`
* `amd64`

## Cleanup

For operator removal, execution of option **cleanup** from sdk-operator is the
recommended way:

```bash
$ operator-sdk cleanup nbde-tang-server
INFO[0002] operatorgroup "operator-sdk-og" deleted
...
INFO[0002] Operator "nbde-tang-server" uninstalled
```

## Tests

Execution of operator tests is pretty simple. These tests don't require any OpenShift/K8S infrastructure installed.
Execute **make test** from top directory and available tests will be executed:

```bash
$ make test
...
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
...
setting up env vars
?       github.com/openshift/nbde-tang-server       [no test files]
?       github.com/openshift/nbde-tang-server/api/v1alpha1  [no test files]
ok      github.com/openshift/nbde-tang-server/controllers   9.720s  coverage: 14.0% of statements
```

As shown previously, coverage is calculated after test execution. Coverage data is dumped
to file **coverage.out**. To inspect coverage graphically, it can be observed by executing
next command:

```bash
$ go tool cover -html=cover.out
```

Previous command will open a web browser with the different coverage reports of the different
files that are part of the controller.

## Function Tests

Function tests are developed in [Tang Operator Test Suite Repository](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tang-operator-tests)

Please, follow instructions in previous repository to execute NBDE Tang Server function tests

## CI/CD

:exclamation: CI/CD is in a continuous "work in progress" state :exclamation:

CI/CD operator is based in Konflux. For more information, please check [Konflux Documentation](https://konflux-ci.dev/docs/)

## Scorecard

As described previously, scorecard test is executed as part of the CI/CD jobs.
However, scorecard tests can be executed manually. In order to execute these tests,
run next command:

```bash
$ operator-sdk scorecard -w 60s quay.io/sec-eng-special/nbde-tang-server-bundle:v1.1.1
...
Results:
Name: olm-status-descriptors
